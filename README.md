# SuperBowl-TV-Analysis
This project gives you an opportunity to apply the skills from Intermediate Python for Data Science.

I visualized the distributions of combined points, point differences, and halftime show performances using histograms. I used line plots to see how ad cost increases lagged behind viewership increases. And discovered that blowouts do appear to lead to a drop in viewers.</p>
